# OCR_for_receipt_invoice
A tool for detecting payment or purchase information through receipt(bill). 
Here I have used an open source API provided by **ASPIRE**. It has limited request response.
Object Character recognition(OCR) provides an new way to automate the processing and tracking of the bill and invoices.
